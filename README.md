Import OSM data to Django

This is intended as a complement to the very excellent work of the [pgosm-flex](https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex) project. It translates the tables generated by the import code there into Django models

## Importing

NOTE: Very much a work in progress

For the importing process we need

 - a pbf file from the area in question
 - lua
 - luarocks


1. Import the pbf file
2. Export the tables
3. Use 'awk' to change schema and prefix the app name
4. Import the tables
